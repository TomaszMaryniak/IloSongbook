<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
[Dm] I got a feeling [Gm] we are gonna [Gm7] win
Our [Bb] bodies make it [C] perfect
And your [Dm] eyes can make me swim

[Dm] Then again [Gm] everything seems [Gm7] new
I can [Bb] barely [C] hold my tongue
To [Dm] say the least I'm into you

[Dm] And your [Gm] [Gm7] eyes
Are [Bb] saying more than [C] we can talk and [Dm] warmer than our bedroom sport

[Dm] And your [Gm] [Gm7] thighs
Are [Bb] kisses from the [C] outside, girl that's [Dm] all I need


[Dm] I'll [Gm] take you [Gm7] down the other road
To [Bb] breathe in [C] something [Dm] more
[Dm] I'll [Gm] find it [Gm7] harder to ignore
The [Bb] things I [C] want you [Dm] for


<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
[Dm] I know you don't want
[Gm] A love you can't sing
[Gm7] The music was at the start
[Bb] Dododododo [C] dododododo [Dm] dodo

[Dm] The rhythm was all
[Gm] I needed to hear
[Gm7] A woman can treat my heart
[Bb] Dododododo [C] dododododo [Dm] dodo


<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
[Dm] When I press an [Gm] ear up to your [Gm7] breast
[Bb] I can hear the [C] rhythm start
It's [Dm] hard to tell our beats apart

[Dm] So I hope you're [Gm] listening right [Gm7] now
Cause [Bb] I can barely [C] hold my tongue
The [Dm] sh*t we do could warm the sun

[Dm] At [Gm] [Gm7] night
[Bb] Twisted in a [C] melting fall and [Dm] sleeping with the scratching claws

[Dm] And [Gm] [Gm7] your words
[Bb] Let me know you're [C] feeling me and [Dm] seeing all the things I see

[Dm] I'll [Gm] take you [Gm7] down the other road
To [Bb] breathe in [C] something [Dm] more
[Dm] I'll [Gm] find it [Gm7] harder to ignore
The [Bb] things I [C] want you [Dm] for


<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
[Dm] I know you don't want
[Gm] A love you can't sing
[Gm7] The music was at the start
[Bb] Dododododo [C] dododododo [Dm] dodo

[Dm] The rhythm was all
[Gm] I needed to hear
[Gm7] A woman can treat my heart
[Bb] Dododododo [C] dododododo [Dm] dodo
