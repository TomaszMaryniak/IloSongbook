Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this [Dm]game     
 [F] ...
[Am]I'm breaking my back just to know your name
[Am]But heaven ain't close in a place like this
[Am]Anything goes but don't blink you [Dm]might miss    
 [F] ...
[Am]Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
[Am]I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
[F]Bring it back down, [G]bring it back down [Am]tonight
[F]Never thought I'd let a [G]rumor ruin my moonlight

<i>Chorus</i>
Well somebody [Am]told me
You had a [F]boyfriend
Who looked like a [G]girlfriend
That I had in [E]February of [Am]last year
It's not [F]confidential
I've got [G]potential

<i>Verse</i>

Taking its toll and I'm leaving without you    [Dm]

A rushin', a [E]rushin' around

I said [C]maybe [Dm]baby [F]please
But I just don't [Am]know now [G]       
 [F] ...
[E]When all I wanna do is try        
 [G] ...
