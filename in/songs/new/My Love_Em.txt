[Intro]
[Em] 


[Verse 1]
[Em] Babe don't try to call
My [D] heart is ticking and the [Am] show, just won't [D] wait [Am]      
 [Em] ...
It's [D] strange, you couldn't see it [Am] my way, hey now [D] go   
 [Am] ...
I [Em] pray for you to fall
The [D] spark, has died and now you're [Am] just too [D] late [Am]       
 [Em] ...
A [D] shame, you're knocking at the [Am] wrong gate, hey go [D] home  
 [Am] ...


[Pre-chorus]
[G] Come what [D] may, I [Am] won't give [C] away


[Chorus 1]
My [Em] love, diamond [Am] rings and Chevrolets
My [C] love, aces [Em] high and cigarettes
My [Em] love, faking [Am] all like Hollywood
My [C] love, love, [Em] love


[Verse 2]
No [Em] way you'll see me crawl
Like a [D] shark I'll be ripping you [Am] apart, and [D] celebrate  [Am]      
 [Em] ...
With lots of [D] champagne, you caught me on the [Am] wrong day, now you [D] know   
 [Am] ...


[Pre-chorus]
[G] Come what [D] may, I [Am] won't give [C] away


[Chorus 2]
My [Em] love, see me [Am] dancing in the rain
My [C] love, no more [Em] whiskey and cocaine
My [Em] love, ending [Am] all forbidden fruit
My [C] love, love, [Em] love


[Break]
[Em]   [C#m/E]   [Am]   [Em] 


[Bridge]
[Em] Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
No you [C#m/B] can't amuse me, so [C#m/E] leave you must
[Am] Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
If the [Em] spell won't kill you, your ego does


[Chorus 3]
My [Em] love, diamond [Am] rings and Chevrolets
My [C] love, no more [Em] tears and no regrets
My [Em] love, time to [Am] lay the man to rest
My [C] love, love, [Em] love
