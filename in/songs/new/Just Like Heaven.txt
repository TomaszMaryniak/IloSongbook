<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>

"Show me, show me, [A] show me how you [E] do that trick
The [Bm] one that makes me [D] scream" she said
"The [A] one that makes me [E] laugh" she said
And [Bm] threw her arms [D] around my neck
[A] "Show me how you [E] do it
And I [Bm] promise you, I [D] promise that
I'll run [A] away with you   
 [E] ...
I'll run [Bm] away with you"  
 [D] ...

[A]   [E]   [Bm]   [D]   [x4] 


<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>

[A] Spinning on that [E] dizzy edge
I [Bm] kissed her face and [D] kissed her head
And [A] dreamed of all the [E] different ways
I [Bm] had to make her [D] glow
[A] "Why are you so [E] far away?" she [Bm] said
"Why won't you [D] ever know that I'm in [A] love with you
 [E] ...
That I'm in [Bm] love with you" 
 [D] ...


<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>

[F#m] You
[G] Soft and only
[F#m] You
[G] Lost and lonely
[F#m] You
[G] Strange as angels
[D] Dancing in the deepest oceans

Twisting in the water
You're just like a [A] dream  
 [E] ...
You're just like a [Bm] dream  
 [D] ...

[A]   [E]   [Bm]   [D]   [x3] 


<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>

[A] Daylight licked me [E] into shape
I [Bm] must have been [D] asleep for days
And [A] moving lips to [E] breathe her name
I [Bm] opened up my [D] eyes
And [A] found myself [E] alone, alone
[Bm] Alone above a [D] raging sea
That [A] stole the only [E] girl I loved
And [Bm] drowned her deep [D] inside of me


<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>

[F#m] You
[G] Soft and only
[F#m] You
[G] Lost and lonely
[F#m] You
[G] Just like heaven
 [D] ...
