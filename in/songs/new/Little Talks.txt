[Intro]
[Am]Hey! [Fmaj7]         [C]     
 [G] ...
[Am]Hey! [Fmaj7]         [C]     
 [G] ...
[Am]Hey! [Fmaj7]         [C]     
 [G] ...
[Am]   [Fmaj7]   [C]   [G]

[Verse 1]
[Am]I don't like [Fmaj7]walking around this old[C]  and empty house
So [Am]hold my hand, I'll [F]walk with you my [C]dear
The [Am]stairs creak [Fmaj7]as you sleep, it's [C]keeping me awake
It's the [Am]house telling [F]you to close your [C]eyes
And [Am]some days [Fmaj7]I can't even[C]  dress myself
It's [Am]killing me to [F]see you this way
 [C] ...

[Chorus]
'Cause though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary, this
[C]ship will [G]carry our
[Am]bodies [F]safe to shore
 [C] ...

[Interlude]
[Am]Hey! [Fmaj7]         [C]     
 [G] ...
[Am]Hey! [Fmaj7]         [C]     
 [G] ...
[Am]Hey! [Fmaj7]         [C]     
 [G] ...
[Am]   [Fmaj7]   [C]   [G]

[Verse 2]
There's an [Am]old voice [Fmaj7]in my head that's[C]  holding me back
Well, [Am]tell her that I [Fmaj7]miss our little [C]talks
[Am]Soon it will be [Fmaj7]over and [C]buried with our past
We [Am]used to play [Fmaj7]outside when we were [C]young (and full of life and full of love)
[Am]Some days [Fmaj7]I don't know if [C]I am wrong or right
Your [Am]mind is playing [Fmaj7]tricks on you my [C]dear

[Chorus]
'Cause though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary, this
[C]ship will [G]carry our
[Am]bodies [Fmaj7]safe to shore[C]    Hey!
Don't [Am]listen to a [Fmaj7]word I [C]say. [G]Hey!
The [Am]screams all [Fmaj7]sound the [C]same. [G]Hey!
Though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary, this
[C]ship will [G]carry our
[Am]bodies [Fmaj7]safe to shore[C]    
 [G] ...

[Instrumental]
[Am]Hey! [Fmaj7]         [C]

[Am]Hey! [Fmaj7]         [C]     
 [G] ...
[Am]   [Fmaj7]   [C]   [G]
[Am]   [Fmaj7]   [C]   [G]
[Am]

[Verse 3]
You're [Am]gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
[Am]All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're [Am]torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just [Am]let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now [Am]wait, wait, [Fmaj7]wait for me.[C]  Please hang around
I'll [Am]see you when I [Fmaj7]fall [C]asleep. Hey!

[Chorus]
Don't [Am]listen to a [Fmaj7]word I [C]say. [G]Hey!
The [Am]screams all [Fmaj7]sound the [C]same. [G]Hey!
Though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary, this
[C]ship will [G]carry our
[Am]bodies [Fmaj7]safe to shore[C]    
 [G] ...

Don't [Am]listen to a [Fmaj7]word I [C]say. [G]Hey!
The [Am]screams all [Fmaj7]sound the [C]same. [G]Hey!
Though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary, this
[C]ship will [G]carry our
[Am]bodies [Fmaj7]safe to shore[C]    
 [G] ...

[Ending]
Though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary, this
[C]ship will [G]carry our
[Am]bodies [Fmaj7]safe to shore
 [C] ...

Though the [Am]truth may [Fmaj7]vary, this
[C]ship will [G]carry our
[Am]bodies [Fmaj7]safe to shore
 [C] ...
