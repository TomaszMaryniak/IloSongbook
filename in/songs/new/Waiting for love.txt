<i>Intro</i>
[Em] [Bm] [C]  [D] [Em]
 
<i>Verse</i>
Where there's a [Em]will, there's a [Bm]way, kinda [C]beautiful
And every n[C]ight has its [D]day, so [Em]magical
And if there's l[Em]ove in this l[Bm]ife, there's no o[C]bstacle
That c[C]an't [D]be defe[Em]ated
 
<i>Verse</i>
For every [Em]tyrant a  t[Bm]ear, for the vu[C]lnerable
In every [C]lost soul, the [D]bones of the [Em]miracle
For every [Em]dreamer, a d[Bm]ream we're uns[C]toppable
With s[C]omething[D]  to beli[Em]eve in
 
<i>Chorus</i>
[C]Monday [G]left me [Em]broken
Tuesday [C]I was [D]through with [Em]hoping
Wednesday my [C]empty a[D]rms were o[Em]pen
Thursday [C]wait[Bm]ing [Am]for l[Em]ove, wait[Bm]ing [Am]for [D]love
[C]Thank the [G]stars it's [Em]Friday
I'm burning like a [C]fire gone [D]wild on [Em]Saturday
Guess I won't be [C]coming to c[D]hurch on [Em]Sunday
I'll be [C]wait[Bm]ing [Am]for [Em]love, [Am]wait[Em]ing [Am]for [D]love
To [C]come around
 
<i>Verse</i>
We are [Em]one of a [Bm]kind irre[C]placeable
How did [C]I get so [D]blind and so [Em]cynical
If theres [Em]love in this [Bm]life we´re un[C]stoppable
No we [C]can´t be[D]  def[Em]eated
 
<i>Chorus</i>
[C]Monday [G]left me [Em]broken

[C]Thank the [G]stars it's [Em]Friday

Guess I won't be [C]coming to c[D]hurch on [Em]Sunday
I'll be [C]wait[Bm]ing [Am]for [Em]love, wait[Bm]ing [Am]for [D]love
To [C]come around
