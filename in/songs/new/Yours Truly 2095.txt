[Intro]
[Am]2095, [Em]2095, [Dm]2095, [Em]2095
[Am]I love you, [Em]sincerely
[F]Yours truly, [G]yours truly...

[Verse]
[Am]I sent a message to [Em]another time
But as the [Dm]days unwind, [Em]this I just can't [Am]believe
[Am]I sent a note across [Em]another plane
Maybe it's [Dm]all a game, but [G]this I just [Em]can't [Am]conceive.
Can you [Am]hear me? [Em]    [F]   [G]   
 [Am] ...

[Verse]
[Am]I drive the very latest[Em]  hovercar
I don't know [Dm]where you are, but I [Em]miss you so much till [Am]then
[Am]I met someone who looks a [Em]lot like you
She does the [Dm]things you do, but [G]she is [Em]an [Am]IBM.

[Bridge]
[Am]2095, [Em]2095, [Dm]2095, [Em]2095
[Am]I love you, [Em]sincerely
[Dm]Yours truly, [Em]yours truly...

[Verse]
[Am]She's only programmed to be [Em]very nice
But she's as [Dm]cold as ice, [Em]whenever I get too [Am]near
[Am]She tells me that she likes me [Em]very much
But when I [Dm]try to touch, [G]she makes it [Em]all too [Am]clear.

[Verse]
[Am]She is the latest in [Em]technology
Almost [Dm]mythology, but [Em]she has a heart of [Am]stone
[Am]She has an I.Q. of [Em]one-thousand-one
She has a [Dm]jumpsuit on, and she's [G]also a [Em][Am]telephone.

[Bridge]
[Am]2095, [Em]2095, [Dm]2095, [Em]2095
[Am]I love you, [Em]sincerely
[F]Yours truly, [G]yours truly...

[Chorus]
[C]Is that what you want? (Is it [F]what you want?)
[C]Is it what you really want? (Is it [G]what you really want?)
[C]Is that what you want? (Is it [F]what you want?)
[G]Is it what you [Am]really [C]want?

[Verse]
[Am]I realize that it must [Em]seem so strange
That time has [Dm]rearranged, but [Em]time has the final [Am]word
[Am]She knows I think of you, she [Em]reads my mind
She tries to [Dm]be unkind, she knows [G]nothing [Em]of our [Am]world

[Verse]
[Am]Although her memory banks [Em]overflow
No one would [Dm]ever know, for all she [Em]says: "Is that what you want?"
[Am]Maybe one day I'll feel her [Em]cold embrace
And kiss her [Dm]interface, 'til [G]then, I'll [Em]leave her [Am]alone.

[Bridge]
[Am]2095, [Em]2095, [Dm]2095, [Em]2095
[Am]I love you, [Em]sincerely
[Dm]Yours truly, [Em]yours truly...
