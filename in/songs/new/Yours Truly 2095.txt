<small><i>(Intro)</i></small>
[Am] 2095, [Em] 2095, [Dm] 2095, [Em] 2095
[Am] I love you, [Em] sincerely
[F] Yours truly, [G] yours truly...

<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
[Am] I sent a message to [Em] another time
But as the [Dm] days unwind, [Em//] this I just [G//] can't [Am] believe
I sent a note across [Em] another plane
Maybe it's [Dm] all a game, but [G//] this I just [Em//] can't [Am] conceive.
Can you [Am] hear me? [Em] ... [F] ... [G]   
 [Am] ...

[Am] I drive the very latest [Em//]  hover[G//]car
I don't know [Dm] where you are, but I [Em//] miss you so [G//] much till [Am] then, I met someone who looks a [Em] lot like you
She does the [Dm] things you do, but [G//]she is [Em//]an [Am]IBM.

<small><i>(Bridge)</i></small>
[Am] 2095, [Em] 2095, [Dm] 2095, [Em] 2095
[Am] I love you, [Em] sincerely
[Dm] Yours truly, [Em] yours truly...


<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
[Am] She's only programmed to be [Em] very nice
But she's as [Dm] cold as ice, [Em//] whenever I [G//] get too [Am] near
[Am] She tells me that she likes me [Em] very much
But when I [Dm] try to touch, [G//] she makes it [Em//] all too [Am] clear.

[Am] She is the latest in [Em] technology
Almost [Dm] mythology, but [Em//] she has a [G//] heart of [Am]stone
[Am] She has an I.Q. of [Em] one-thousand-one
She has a [Dm] jumpsuit on, and she's [G//]also a [Em//] tele[Am]phone.

[Am] 2095, [Em] 2095, [Dm] 2095, [Em] 2095
[Am] I love you, [Em] sincerely
[F] Yours truly, [G] yours truly...

<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
[C] Is that what you want? (Is it [F] what you want?)
[C] Is it what you really want? (Is it [G] what you really want?)
[C] Is that what you want? (Is it [F] what you want?)
[G] Is it what you [Am] really [C] want?

<small><i>(Verse)</i></small>
[Am] I realize that it must [Em] seem so strange
That time has [Dm] rearranged, but [Em//] time has [G//] the final [Am] word
[Am] She knows I think of you, she [Em] reads my mind
She tries to [Dm] be unkind, she knows [G//]nothing [Em//]of our [Am]world

[Am] Although her memory banks [Em] overflow
No one would [Dm] ever know, for all she [Em//]says: "Is [G//] that what you want?"
[Am] Maybe one day I'll feel her [Em] cold embrace
And kiss her [Dm] interface, 'til [G//] then, I'll [Em//] leave her [Am]alone.

[Am] 2095, [Em] 2095, [Dm] 2095, [Em] 2095
[Am] I love you, [Em] sincerely
[Dm] Yours truly, [Em] yours truly...

<small><i>(Chorus)</i></small>
[C] Is that what you want? (Is it [F] what you want?)
[C] Is it what you really want? (Is it [G] what you really want?)
[C] Is that what you want? (Is it [F] what you want?)
[G] Is it what you [Am] really [C] want?
