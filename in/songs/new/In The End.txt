<i>Verse</i>
 
It starts with [Dm]one thing I don't know why
It [C]doesn't even matter how hard you try
[Bb]Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To [C]explain in due time
All I [Dm]know, time is a valuable thing
[C]Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
[Bb]Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock [C]ticks life away
It's so [Dm]unreal, didn't look out below
[C]Watch the time go right out the window
[Bb]Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I [C]wasted it all just to
Watch you [Dm]go, I kept everything inside
And even [C]though I tried, it all fell apart
[Bb]What it meant to me will eventually be
A [C]memory of a time when
 
 
<i>Chorus</i>
 
I tried so [Dm]hard and got so [F]far
But in the [C]end it doesn't even [Bb]matter
I had to [Dm]fall to lose it [F]all
But in the [C]end it doesn't even [Bb]matter
 
 
<i>Verse</i>
 
[Dm]One thing, I don't know why
It [C]doesn't even matter how hard you try
[Bb]Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To [C]remind myself how
I tried so [Dm]hard, in spite of the way you were mocking me
[C] Acting like I was part of your property
[Bb]  Remembering all the times you fought with me
[C]  I'm surprised it got [Dm]so far
 
Things aren't the way they were before
[C]You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
[Bb]  Not that you knew me back then
But it [C]all comes back to me
In the [Dm]end you kept everything inside
And even [C]though I tried, it all fell apart
[Bb]What it meant to me will eventually be
A [C]memory of a time when
 
 
<i>Chorus</i>
 
I tried so [Dm]hard and got so [F]far
But in the [C]end it doesn't even [Bb]matter
I had to [Dm]fall to lose it [F]all
But in the [C]end it doesn't even [Bb]matter
 
 
<i>Bridge</i>
 
I've put my [Dm]trust in [C]you
Pushed as [Bb]far as I can [C]go
And for all [Dm]this
There's only [C]one thing you should [Bb]know [C] ...I've put my [Dm]trust in [F]you
Pushed as [C]far as I can [Bb]go
And for all [Dm]this
There's only [F]one thing you should [Bb]know
 
 
<i>Chorus</i>
 
I tried so [Dm]hard and got so [F]far
But in the [C]end it doesn't even [Bb]matter
